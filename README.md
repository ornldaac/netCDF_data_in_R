**UPDATE:** The repo was updated on 2024-01-02. The R code was rewritten to remove dependencies on the *rgdal* and *raster* packages.  The code now uses functions of the *terra* package for raster data.

# 1. Overview

In this tutorial we will open some geospatial data that is stored in a netCDF file. Then we will select the variable and time range of interest and export the data as a GeoTIFF file so that we can continue the analysis in R or other geospatial software.

# 2. Dataset

**Long-Term Arctic Growing Season NDVI Trends from GIMMS 3g, 1982-2012**

The dataset used in this tutorial provides normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for the Arctic growing season derived primarily with data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors on board several NOAA satellites over the years 1982 through 2012. The NDVI data, which show vegetation activity, were averaged annually for the arctic growing season (June, July, and August) in each year. The data are circumpolar in coverage at 8-kilometer resolution and limited to greater than 20 degrees North.
